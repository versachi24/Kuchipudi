  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Kuchipudi was performed as a dance drama with several dancers taking different roles.
  According to tradition, the dance was originally performed only by men and they all belonged to the Brahmin community.
  These Brahmin families were known popularly as Bhagavathalu of Kuchipudi.</p>

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Their programs were offerings to the deities and they never allowed women in their groups.
   Men performed the roles of both female and male characters. The themes of the dramas were derived from the
   scriptures and Hindu mythology making it a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual places.</p>

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the 15th century, a saint called Siddhendra Yogi, codified the movements and enriched the repertoire of the Kuchipudi dance form.
  As a learned and religious poet, he composed verses and choreographed numerous dances all in praise of the deities.
  Recognized as the father of Kuchipudi, Siddhendra Yogi championed the cause of redefining this dance form aiming at elimination exploitation of women.
  Kuchipudi was enriched by the advent of the female dancers.</p>


  <h2><center>Decline and Revival</center></h2>
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Kuchipudi enjoyed support from medieval era rulers. Historical artifacts suggest that the dance-drama was seen
  by the royalty and was influential by the 1500s and through the late 16th century.
  The court records of the Vijaya Nagara Empire (present day Andhra Pradesh) – known for its patronage of the
  Indian religions and arts – indicate that drama-dance troupes of Bhagavatas from Kuchipudi village performed at the royal court.</p>

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Unfortunately, with the fall of the Vijaya Nagara Empire, Islamic invasions and formation of Deccan Sultanates
  in the 16th century, many temples were destructed. In turn, many musicians and artists migrated to the south to the
  Tanjore Kingdom (present day Tamil Nadu), however some remained back in the village of Kuchipudi and those who remained
  became the sole custodians of its tradition in Andhra.</p>

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Kuchipudi declined and was a dying art in the beginning of the 17th-century, however the last Shia Muslim Nawabs were
  very pleased by a Kuchipudi performance, he granted the dancers lands around the Kuchipudi village, with the stipulation that they
  continue the dance-drama. However, things took a turn and in the late 17th century, the emperor banned public
  performances of all music and dance arts and ordered the confiscation and destruction of musical instruments.</p>

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With the arrival of the Europeans, Andhra became a part of the Madras presidency and Hindu arts and traditions were remained silenced.
  Post-independence, due to the efforts of renowned Gurus, classical dance was brought back to light.</p>

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With the fall of the Mughal Empire, the colonial Europeans arrived. Andhra became a part of the
  Madras presidency and Hindu arts and traditions were once again ridiculed and silenced.
  Ultimatley, in 1910 the presidency banned temple dancing as well and caused Indians to protest.
  Protesting against cultural discrimination, the people sought to preserve what was
  rightfully theirs and have it come back to light on stage.</p>

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Due to the dedicated efforts of Vedantam LakshmiNarayana Sastry, Bala Saraswathi, and Tadepalli Perayya,
  Kuchipudi has paved its way to the international stage. Kuchipudi was further stylized and formalized to include solo dancing
  by the zeal of dancers such as Vempati Venkatanarayan, Vempati China Satyam and Sobha Naidu. A number of other luminaries
  molded Kuchipudi into its present shape, and among them Dr.Vempati China Satyam is considered the trend-setter.

  <h2><center>Performance</center></h2>
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The Kuchipudi dance begins with worship rituals. A dancer moves about sprinkling holy water, and then incense
  is burned. The flagstaff of the god Indra is planted on the stage to guard the performance against outside interference. Women sing
  and dance with worship lamps, followed by the worship of <i>Ganesha</i> (god of obstacles) of <i>Saraswati</i> (goddess of learning),
  and <i>Lakshmi</i>(goddess of wealth), in between chanting drum syllables.
  </p>

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then each principal character introduces himself or herself on the stage with a daru.
  A daru is a small composition of dance and song specially designed for each character to help him or her
  reveal his or her identity and also to show the performer’s skill in the art. There are nearly 80 darus
  or dance sequences in the dance drama.
