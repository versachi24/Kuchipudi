	 <u> The Website Itself </u>
	 <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I enjoyed designing this website from the start. I put in a lot of time and learned new HTML properties.
	 A picture is worth a 1000 words. However, I didn't want my viewers to solely look at images scrolling down.
	 On my homepage, the pictures are used for navigation and are oval-rounded. On the contact page, the pictures are rotated so the
	 viewer looks toward the center of the picture where the main information is.</p>
	 <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I focused a lot on playing with images. The text on the pictures of the dance forms were formatted and styled
	 based on the color of the picture. For example, the Kathak dancers had on white dresses. Their dress color is
	 the same color as the text. I liked to keep the colors consistent even if its something as subtle as this.</p>
	 <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Most of this content can be found on the internet by many people. However, I wanted a authentic information,
	 information that I know is from a primary source. I spent hours talking with my teacher face-to-face, taking notes and asking questions
	 about his journey and about his teacher. Drafting, erasing, and finalizing all this content to be the true information took a lot of effort.
	 I have been learning this dance form for the past 7 years and not many people know about its history.
	 I wanted to share this ancient yet modern art and I feel like this is the best opportunity to collect and present all this information.</p>
	 <br>
	 <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I think my website could have better with a better use of Javascript.
   Another interesting aspect I could've dealt with is having CSS rollover effect on the images on
   the index page.</p>
