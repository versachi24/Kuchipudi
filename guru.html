		<h1> Dr.Vempati China Satyam</h1>
		<p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Referred as <i>Master garu</i> by his disciples, Dr.Vempati was considered
      the trendsetter among his contemporaries. Master garu had set pace for the exlempary work
      his own disciples did in the latter years for propagating Kuchipudi as the modern
      dance form while keeping the time worn tradition intact.
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He took the dance form from the obscure corner of Andhra Pradesh to the world stage
      by performing with his fellow artists around the world and spearheading the
      setting up of dance schools in the Western world. Master garu's style is known
      for his flawless technical brilliance, well-defined crisp lines of the body
      combined with innovation, creativity, to communicate the barriers of language and culture.
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dr.Vempati composed 180 solo pieces and 15 ballets most of whihc are being staged vebatim
      by his disciplines everywhere.

  	<h1>Sastry Bhagavatula </h1>
  	<p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hailing from the Bhagavatula Family of Kuchipudi, Sastry Bhagavatula was born in the Indian Village of Kuchipudi but was raised in Hyderabad, India.
    Sastry is the son of Sri. Bhagavatula Lakshmi Narasimham who is an expert in Mridangam and Ghatam. His father is also a noted scholar of Yakshagana
    and presented many articles on the dance form of Kuchipudi and is also serving as guest faculty for Kuchipudi dance at Telugu University and Central University.
    Sastry studied Mridangam under his father and has won several prestigious awards. Sastry accompanied artists such as Arundhati Sarkar among others.</p>

    <p><i><u><b>Kuchipudi Journey:</b></u></i>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; His father’s cousin brother, Sri.Bhagavatula Rama Kottayya garu, was a Kuchipudi guru and used to teach students at his home.
    At the small age of five, Sasty used to go to his uncle’s house and watched other students perform Kuchipudi. Eager to learn, he requested his uncle to teach him and after
    his parents gave permission, Sastry started his intial training of Kuchipudi from Sri Bhagavatula Ramakottayya Garu.</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Guru Sri. Vempati Chinna Satyam, referred as Mastergaru by Sastry, happened to see his dance when he was at the age of eight and was very
    much impressed. Master garu asked Sastry to come and practice dance at his school in Madras during Sastry's summer holidays. After a couple of years, again on Master garu command,
    Sastry attended the Teachers Training Course at the Kuchipudi Village. The course was to make sure Kuchipudi teachers follow and teach one form of dance style.
    Sastry enrolled in took this rigorous training for 3 consecutive summers at Siddhendra Kalakshetram in Kuchipudi Village.</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;During high school, he got an opportunity to potray a presitgious role,
    in a Sanskrit TV show which was choereographed by Master Garu. During his college days, Sastry also
    directed and choreographed <i>Kumara Sambhavam"</i> a Kuchipudi Dance Ballet

    <i>Srinivasa Kalyanam</i> and <i>Ksheera Sagara Madhanam</i> playing important roles. He has toured with Mastergaru and
    has performed in all the major cities of India. When Sastry came to U.S.A, Mastergaru advised him to teach
    and spread this art form. Since 2001 Sastry has been teaching Kuchipudi to his students in Corning and Rochester NY,
    without taking any money and thus following the footsteps of his guru to promote this art selflessly.</p>
